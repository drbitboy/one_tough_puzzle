# one_tough_puzzle
Designed to find a restricted solution, ir possible, to the One Tough Puzzle by Great American Puzzle Factory.

Restriction:  assume all pieces are rotated the same way in the solution (and per the image below):

* Top innie
* Left outie
* Bottom outie
* Right innie

In that case, there is no solution.

The Python script's docstring contains the pieces' definition, again per the image below.
